# Description
**WIZARD PUNKS!!!** is a fast-paced, spell-slinging 4-player local party game, inspired by the classic couch party games of the early 2010s. With a unique system of combining elements to craft spells, the powers of Air, Earth, Fire and Water are yours to control and mix.

With its rapid-fire, hilarity-inducing, tense gameplay **WIZARD PUNKS!!!** is a quirky and competitive game that is fun to play and to spectate.

## Four Unique Elements

- **Air** - A flowing Wind Helix, or a powerful homing pull
- **Earth** - A jagged Giant Rock, or chaotic ricocheting bounces
- **Fire** - A burning Sun Laser, or a bombastic exploding blast
- **Water** - A chilling Frost Bubble, or a ground-piercing phasing bolt

Each spell you create uses up to three elements. One for the base, and two for the modification effects. Create a bouncing, homing laser by creating a spell with **Fire/Air/Earth** or use the same elements to create an exploding, homing boulder with **Earth/Fire/Air**.

## Key Features

- Local Multiplayer For Up To 4 Players
- 2 Punktastic Game Modes
- 20 Unlockable Palettes
- 4 Unique Elements - With 68 Unique Spell Combinations
- CPU Opponents With 3 Different Difficulties
- Original Wizarding Soundtrack
